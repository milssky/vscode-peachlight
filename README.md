# Peachlight

The "Peachlight" theme for Visual Studio Code is a warm, light theme designed to provide a calm and visually pleasing coding environment. It features soft peach and pastel shades that reduce eye strain, offering a welcoming alternative to traditional bright themes. The themeâ€™s colors balance warm peaches, gentle pinks, and muted yellows for background tones, paired with complementary shades of purple, blue, and green for syntax highlighting. This subtle color contrast ensures that code elements stand out without being overly bright, making it ideal for long coding sessions or for users who prefer a minimalistic, aesthetically pleasing workspace.
